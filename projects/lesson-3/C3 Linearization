contract O
contract A is O
contract B is O
contract C is O
contract K1 is A, B
contract K2 is A, C
contract Z is K1, K2

mro(A) = [A, O]
mro(B) = [B, O]
mro(C) = [C, O]
mro(K1) = [K1] + merge(mro(A), mro(B), [A, B])
= [K1] + merge([A, O], [B, O], [A, B])
= [K1, A] + merge([O], [B, O], [B])
= [K1, A, B] + merge([O], [O])
= [K1, A, B, O]
同理
mro(K2)=[K2, A, C, O]
计算Z：
mro(Z)=[Z]+merge(mro(K1), mro(K2), [K1, K2])
=[Z]+merge([K1, A, B, O],[ K2, A, C, O], [K1, K2])
=[Z,K1]+merge( A, B, O],[ K2, A, C, O], [ K2])
=[Z,K1,K2]+merge( A, B, O],[ A, C, O])
=[Z,K1,K2,A,B,C,O]
